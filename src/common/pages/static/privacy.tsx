              The Company may have offices outside of the EU and may have affiliates and service
              providers in the United States and in other countries. Your personal information may
              be transferred to or from the United States or other locations outside of your state,
              province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as

            <p>
              EU users should read the important information provided below about transfer of

            <h2>HOW INFORMATION IS SECURED</h2>
            <p>
              We retain information we collect as long as it is necessary and relevant to fulfill
              the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. In addition, we retain personal
              information to comply with applicable law where required, prevent fraud, resolve
              disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our Terms of
              Service, and other actions permitted by law. To determine the appropriate retention
              period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of
              the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or
              disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your
              personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
              and the applicable legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no
              longer be associated with you) in which case we may use this information indefinitely
              without further notice to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              We employ industry standard security measures designed to protect the security of all
              information submitted through the Services. However, the security of information
              transmitted through the internet can never be guaranteed. We are not responsible for
              any interception or interruption of any communications through the internet or for
              changes to or losses of data. Users of the Services are responsible for maintaining
              the security of any password, user ID or other form of authentication involved in
              obtaining access to password protected or secure areas of any of our digital services.

              at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the the Site or Services

              the Services only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal
              guardian. Consistent with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection
              Act (COPPA), if we learn that we have received any information directly from a child
              under age 13 without first receiving his or her parent's verified consent, we will use
              that information only to respond directly to that child (or his or her parent or legal
              guardian) to inform the child that he or she cannot use the Site and subsequently we
              will delete that information.

              We only use your personal information as permitted by law. We are required to inform
              you of the legal bases of our processing of your personal information, which are
              described in the table below. If you have questions about the legal bases under which
              we process your personal information, contact us at info@ecency.com.

              consider and balance any potential impacts on you (both positive and negative) and
              your rights before we process your personal information for our legitimate interests.
              We do not use your personal information for activities where our interests are
              overridden by any adverse impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise

              unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the applicable legal basis for that
              use. If we have relied upon your consent for a particular use of your personal
              information, we will seek your consent for any unrelated purpose.
            </p>
