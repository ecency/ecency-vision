              8.3. You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field. Advances
              in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers

            <h2>9. The Services</h2>

              9.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things, provide
              software that facilitates the submission of Hive blockchain transaction data to the
              Hive blockchain without requiring you to access the Hive blockchain command line
              interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              9.2. Account and Private Keys. Should you agree to create an Account through our
              Service, we generate a cryptographic private and public key pair that are provided
              solely to you and completely owned by you; provided however that we not store
              passwords or Private Keys for our you. We never have access to your Private Key and do
              not custody any Private Keys on your behalf, and therefore, assume no responsibility
              for the management of the Private Key tied to your Account. The Private Key uniquely
              match the Account name and must be used in connection with the Account to authorize
              the transfer of HIVE and Hive Dollars from that Account. You are solely responsible
              for maintaining the security of your Private Keys. You must keep your Private Key
              access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of HIVE,
              Hive Power and Hive Dollars associated with your Account.
            </p>
            <p>
              9.3. No Password Retrieval. We do not receive or store your Account password or
              Private Keys. Your Private Key is your own and you are solely responsible for their
              safekeeping. We cannot assist you with Account password retrieval, reset, or recovery.
              You are solely responsible for remembering your Account password. If you have not
              safely stored a backup of any Account and password pairs maintained in your Account,
              you accept and acknowledge that any HIVE, Hive Dollars and Hive Power you have
              associated with such Account will become permanently inaccessible if you do not have
              your Account password.
            </p>
            <p>
              9.4. Transactions. All proposed Hive blockchain transactions must be confirmed and
              recorded in the Hive blockchain via the Hive distributed consensus network (a
              peer-to-peer network), which is not owned, controlled, or operated by us. The Hive
              blockchain is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. We
              have no control over the Hive blockchain and therefore cannot and will not ensure that
              any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed on the Hive
              blockchain. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the
              Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Hive
              blockchain. You may use the Services to submit these details to the Hive blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              9.5. No Storage or Transmission of HIVE, Hive Dollars or Hive Power. HIVE, in any of
              its forms (HIVE, Hive Dollars and Hive Power) is an intangible, digital asset
              controlled by you. These assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record
              maintained on the Hive blockchain. The Service does not store, send, or receive HIVE,
              Hive Dollars, or Hive Power. Any transfer of title that might occur in any HIVE, Hive
              Dollars or Hive Power occurs on the Hive blockchain and not within the Services. We do
              not guarantee that the Service can affect the transfer of title or right in any HIVE,
              Hive Dollars or Hive Power.
            </p>
            <p>
              9.6. Relationship. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to nor shall create any
              partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy, or trusteeship, between you and us.
            </p>
            <p>
              9.7. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you
              provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we
              are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any
              Hive blockchain transaction initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype
              an Account name or otherwise provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you
              to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              9.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted
              to the Hive blockchain via the Services, The Services cannot assist you to cancel or
              otherwise modify your transaction details. We have no control over the Hive blockchain
              and do not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.
            </p>
            <p>
              9.9. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the
              transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via the Services,
              and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate
              tax authority. You agree that the we are not responsible for determining whether taxes
              apply to your Hive blockchain transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding,
              or remitting any taxes arising from any Hive blockchain transactions.
            </p>
