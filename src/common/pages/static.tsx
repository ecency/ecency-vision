                            where it is inaccurate, and you may do so at any time by logging in to your account. This right shall only
                            be limited where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your
                            privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. If you
                            close your S account, we will mark your account in our database as &quot;Closed,&quot; but will keep your
                            account information in our database for a period of time described above. This is necessary in order to
                            deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply
                            by closing their account and opening a new account. However, if you close your account, your personally
                            identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third
                            parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in
                            accordance with this Privacy Policy.
