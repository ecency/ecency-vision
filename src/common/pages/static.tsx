                        <p>In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you) in which case we may use this
                            information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
                        <p>We employ industry standard security measures designed to protect the security of all information submitted through the Services. However, the security
                            of information transmitted through the internet can never be guaranteed. We are not responsible for any interception or interruption of any

                            password, user ID or other form of authentication involved in obtaining access to password protected or secure areas of any of our digital services.</p>

                        <p>8.3. You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of
                            quantum computers may present risks to the Services that you use and your Account, which could result in the theft or loss of your property. By using

                        <h2>9. The Services</h2>
                        <p>9.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things, provide software that facilitates the submission of Hive blockchain transaction
                            data to the Hive blockchain without requiring you to access the Hive blockchain command line interface.</p>
                        <p>9.2. Account and Private Keys. Should you agree to create an Account through our Service, we generate a cryptographic private and public key pair that
                            are provided solely to you and completely owned by you; provided however that we not store passwords or Private Keys for our you. We never have access
                            to your Private Key and do not custody any Private Keys on your behalf, and therefore, assume no responsibility for the management of the Private Key
                            tied to your Account. The Private Key uniquely match the Account name and must be used in connection with the Account to authorize the transfer of HIVE
                            and Hive Dollars from that Account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Private Keys. You must keep your Private Key access
                            information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of HIVE, Hive Power and Hive Dollars associated with your Account.</p>
                        <p>9.3. No Password Retrieval. We do not receive or store your Account password or Private Keys. Your Private Key is your own and you are solely responsible
                            for their safekeeping. We cannot assist you with Account password retrieval, reset, or recovery. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account
                            password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Account and password pairs maintained in your Account, you accept and acknowledge that any HIVE,
                            Hive Dollars and Hive Power you have associated with such Account will become permanently inaccessible if you do not have your Account password.</p>
                        <p>9.4. Transactions. All proposed Hive blockchain transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Hive blockchain via the Hive distributed consensus
                            network (a peer-to-peer network), which is not owned, controlled, or operated by us. The Hive blockchain is operated by a decentralized network of
                            independent third parties. We have no control over the Hive blockchain and therefore cannot and will not ensure that any transaction details you submit
                            via the Services will be confirmed on the Hive blockchain. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be
                            completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Hive blockchain. You may use the Services to submit these details to the Hive blockchain.</p>
                        <p>9.5. No Storage or Transmission of HIVE, Hive Dollars or Hive Power. HIVE, in any of its forms (HIVE, Hive Dollars and Hive Power) is an intangible,
                            digital asset controlled by you. These assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Hive blockchain. The Service does not
                            store, send, or receive HIVE, Hive Dollars, or Hive Power. Any transfer of title that might occur in any HIVE, Hive Dollars or Hive Power occurs on the
                            Hive blockchain and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service can affect the transfer of title or right in any HIVE, Hive Dollars or
                            Hive Power.</p>
                        <p>9.6. Relationship. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to nor shall create any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy, or trusteeship, between
                            you and us.</p>
                        <p>9.7. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and
                            acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Hive blockchain transaction initiated via the
                            Services, for instance, if you mistype an Account name or otherwise provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction
                            details carefully before completing them via the Services.</p>
                        <p>9.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Hive blockchain via the Services, The Services cannot assist
                            you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. We have no control over the Hive blockchain and do not have the ability to facilitate any
                            cancellation or modification requests.</p>
                        <p>9.9. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via
                            the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that the we are not
                            responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Hive blockchain transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes
                            arising from any Hive blockchain transactions.</p>
                        <h2>10. Fees for Using the Services</h2>
                        <p>10.1. Fees Creating an Account. We do not currently charge fees for the creation of Accounts, however we reserve the right to do so in future, and in
                            such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any Service to which a fee applies.</p>
