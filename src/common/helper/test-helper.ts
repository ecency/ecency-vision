    body: "Hi\n\nI have decided to write this article for newcomers (that need some guidance), for more experienced ones (that can contribute with input, commenting, and helping with suggestions for this article), and for myself. So, please, keep this in mind, as you read it.\n***If you’re already in Hive and wish to help with an idea, your comment could make you a benefactor for me and for others. So, I am thanking you right from the start for reading and helping us with a suggestion, advice, anything.***\n\n![regenerette_bannerleofinance.png](https://images.ecency.com/DQmSCnuynBe64vowY7Q87JwDJPQN6iaArnCU9vPbsdWzyCw/regenerette_bannerleofinance.png)\n\n\n\nHive eco-system is the source of our crypto funds, a win-win social tool that provides you with great opportunities to reach your goals. ***But do you know how to manage these crypto funds in the most efficient way so that you really achieve more soon? ***\n\n\n![stage_with_hologram3_min.png](https://images.ecency.com/DQmQYZdH6qJQMxSaZYoCSCzSXmRn4qVGJBg6iinHBU1wH2M/stage_with_hologram3_min.png)\n\n\nWouldn’t it be nice if there were a magic formula or simple trick that allowed you never to worry about your daily “hiving around” or manage your crypto finances better?\n \nI’d like to show you a simple Hive mindset for myself, a newbie. I’d love it if others could help me understand more practical ways to enrich my strategy for HIVING AROUND and making more per day. \nHere I have uncovered 5 key approaches to self-financing that help me and might help you improve your crypto skills in Hive:\n\n**1** **Sort it all out and prioritize**:\n\nTake time to think about your final goal, which dream would you like to realize? How you can achieve it, obviously it would require a certain time and healthy use of funds you receive from HIVE.\n\nSet long-term and short-term goals. Think about what you can do today to come closer to the desired result.\n\n\n**2 Define time-bounds**:\n\nBoth long-term and short-term goals should be specific, have a date, be measurable and realistic. Do you have debts? Pay them off to be free of any hurdles on the way towards your financial achievements. Create a sample plan a monthly budget and a spending plan to obtain full control of the situation.\n\nBy the way, you can track all funds that you raise here on your Hive account that is integrated into your personal account. Keep analyzing the money you make weekly, monitor your progress, and see where you are from the final goal.\n\n\n**3 Create an emergency fund**:\n\nIt's no surprise that when life presents an emergency, it threatens your financial well-being and causes stress. If you're living without a safety net, you're living on the \"financial\" edge, hoping to get by without running into a crisis.\n\nBeing prepared with an emergency crypto fund gives you confidence that you can tackle any of life's unexpected events without adding money worries to your list. You can always count on the power of our community, there are so many people ready to help you out, still, it is always better to create \"a safety bag\".\nPeople in Hive now have the option to use https://buymeberries.com/ to donate for others. \n#bmbhome\n\n\n**4 Budget is always important**:\n\nYou can make your budget as detailed as you want, as long as it helps you reach the ultimate Hive goal of spending less than you make, always save for the future. Stake maybe?\n\nA crypto budget will also help you decide how to spend your crypto, and what to invest in over the coming months and years. Without the plan, you might spend liquidity on things that seem important now, but don't offer much in terms of enhancing your future.\n\n\n**5 Seek advice**:\n\nIf you feel a lack of practical skills, if you don't know how to manage Hive tokens, don't be afraid to seek Hive advice. \n\nI am asking HIVE more experienced users to give any advice to new users by commenting on this post. Let us know what to do besides just posting and answering other people's posts. What else can we do to get more tokens, more HP, and more…anything? Contest? Farming? – How does one farm? Delegating and who? What else?\n\n@regenerette\n\n![banner_laleo.png](https://images.ecency.com/DQmXqfSMryc41TJAmD85CSrxrNqKzMntu6EDss8xnMSXQXt/banner_laleo.png)\n\n\nThank you for reading!\n~ I live today for me and for others ~\nWhy not join [JOIN HIVE](https://peakd.com/register?ref=regenerette) and become part of this amazing community!!!?\n\n\n![loepng.png](https://images.ecency.com/DQmdfMBTEXfzHRiVLq53vcPwfa1saXBhKcDKr1eqeg9P2Jr/loepng.png)\n\n![fxx5caie56ynwsjysm2xunozdmysq1yndrbt9x9veernm1981q9qbbm7xzs6mzhztz7px8zewhj4dosulcvjgksndfg731eqtdzgoj35wnxx.gif](https://images.ecency.com/DQmQLVPEJy2gTRgnK73SpAHuQbWguZkoAQLcM5dqhsEKHgr/fxx5caie56ynwsjysm2xunozdmysq1yndrbt9x9veernm1981q9qbbm7xzs6mzhztz7px8zewhj4dosulcvjgksndfg731eqtdzgoj35wnxx.gif)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosted Using [LeoFinance <sup>Beta</sup>](https://leofinance.io/@regenerette/we-need-each-one-of-you-sos-financial-advice-for-hive-newcomers)",

      body: "Hello everyone,\n\nEarlier in [Hivesigner updates](/hive/@good-karma/hivesigner-ongoing-development-and-improvement), I mentioned that [integrating Hivesigner into Hive.blog](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/issues/43) would be huge steps for giving similar user experience across Hive applications.\n\nOne of the first steps were to solve Imagehoster issue or rather expand it to allow image uploads if user Logged in via Hivesigner.\n\n![](https://images.ecency.com/p/Y2iXpRRkNSnseh3NuL6KUBitJTXrc5K2vbTzBseGEENcE)\n\n## Imagehoster + Hivesigner\n\nImagehoster works by signing image file with user's private key and then use signature to upload image file. On server side, signature is verified with image file content and accepted/stored.\n\nHivesigner being OAuth2 works slightly different, so we couldn't sign the image file before uploading to Imagehoster because we don't have access to user's private keys. But each application has `accessToken` issued by Hivesigner with user's permission. [I just created Merge Request into Imagehoster](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/imagehoster/-/merge_requests/1) which uses `accessToken` for verifying application, user account and uploads image.\n\nOnce accepted by @blocktrades team, we can start working on next step [Condenser Hivesigner integration](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/issues/43). \n\n## Condenser Bounty\n\nIf you are familiar with condenser source code: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser, here is a challenge and programming task to get first hand experience on how Condenser and Hivesigner works, earn extra reward while learning.\n\nAnnouncing Bounty for integrating Hivesigner OAuth2 into hive.blog and wallet.hive.blog.\n\n**Bounty prize: 1000 HBD**\nRelated issue: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/issues/43\n\nIntegration examples to get started: Esteem/Ecency [desktop](https://github.com/esteemapp/esteem-surfer/blob/master/app/helpers/sc.js) and [mobile](https://github.com/esteemapp/esteem-mobile/blob/development/src/providers/steem/steemConnect.js) apps, as well as https://demo.hivesigner.com.\n\n\nIf anyone interested adding into prize pool, please feel free to reach out or leave a comment.\n\n# Hive on!\n\n## Support Hivesigner\n\n- [Read details of Hivesigner proposal](https://esteem.app/hive/@good-karma/hivesigner-ongoing-development-and-improvement)\n- [Vote for proposal using Hivesigner](https://hivesigner.com/sign/update-proposal-votes?proposal_ids=%5B88%5D&approve=true)\n- PeakD: https://peakd.com/proposals/88\n- HiveBlog Wallet: https://wallet.hive.blog/proposals\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/pNJn7wh",

We were the first one to adopt beneficiaries when it was introduced and rewards did help us over the years to at least cover some part of server costs. After re-evaluating recently we decided to drop it altogether.\n- Drafts, now you can access your drafts which you saved from mobile app or save drafts, re-use old drafts, vice versa.\n- Bookmarks and Favorites, also added Bookmarking post and Favoriting authors so you can quickly access your favorities. It is synced across the device of course, you can check your bookmarks from mobile app and vice versa.\n- Gallery, all your uploaded images are available in your Gallery page, so you can re-use them quickly or download them when you need again.\n- Recent posts, great way to read more from same author, now wether you are reading post or comment, you get chance to read more from same author and connect.\n- Code improvements and optimization, we want to keep codebase clean and performance top notch possible, so regular optimization. Also after couple more updates, we will opensource website entirely so you can take a look and help if have development experience.\n\n---\nMobile application will also get update in next 48 hours with improvements, bug fixes and of course, no beneficiary rewards or fees.\n\nStay tuned, stay excited!

Things are running smoothly so far, but we can do better, improve rankings and add different ranking options, etc.\n\nWe would like to Thank everyone who took their time to support proposal and do their part to improve search engine and make it open for all developers.\n\nHivesearcher needs your support to help us improve the system for everyone and open access to all Dapps.

After release of Ecency website, we will be rolling out Ecency mobile and desktop apps with improvements we have been working on. If you missed last [development update read about it here](/ecency/@ecency/ecency-development-update-09-07-2020). In this post we will talk about some changes in mobile and desktop apps.\n\n![Ecency-release-logo](https://images.ecency.com/DQmdWiLkE1ccp9UYnXbz6ofsxkUhYQo1eCh9X24kKLYTk3a/ecency_announcement.png)\n\n# Ecency Web\n\nFirst, let us start with progress of website. We have all social features implemented, these days finalizing wallet and points operations. We think for initial release we have majority of the features we want and after official release and rebrand, we will continue to add features you all love. While keeping performance of website top-notch.\n\n# Ecency Mobile\n\nMobile app will have better support for communities, new branding images, improvements in push notifications, signup within app in seconds, request delegation boost if you run out of RC, with app it is super easy, couple clicks away and you are good to continue enjoying Hive experience. Search page will also get improvement which will include community posts and unified search feature. Many more design and post rendering improvements, bug fixes. Ecency website will have mobile friendly interface as well, so we expect mobile and website experience will compliment each other.\n\n# Ecency Desktop\n\nFor last couple years, we have put most of our efforts into this product (Esteem Desktop/Surfer app) instead of developing website. It was great experience but we learnt that in today's world not many people prefer installing apps on their computer. Desktop apps are more secure and unstoppable, so we are going to continue preserve desktop app for as long as we can. Because it serves decent number of people who like more security and privacy in crypto space.  We will likely port our new website into desktop application.\nIn desktop app, you have full control over which server you connect to, you have full control of your private keys and it gives you access to truly uncensored data. Websites are prone to DMCA and other government laws and they are enforced by domain/server service providers, but desktop apps doesn't have such limitation making them best way to access uncensored content.

      body: "This proposal is a request for funding to pay for the development and maintenance of search engine that provides search functionality to hive.blog, peak.com, ecency.com and other potential Hive apps.\n\n# Project Title\n\nOpen Search Engine development and maintenance\n\n<center>![Blockchain-based-Open-Search-Engine](https://images.ecency.com/DQmcAKfEJdgj55sTB3gWTVMzw6WtZ5K9V3uwbH83DA9a8QM/thumbnail.png)</center>\n\n# Proposal Type\n\nHive service - Opensource\n\n# Costs\n\n**Daily: 45 HBD**\nMonthly: 1350 HBD\n\n---\n\nLabor (Development+Management): ~25 hours per month, 750 HBD\nRecurring costs (Servers): ~$600, ~600 HBD\n\nProgress reporting: Bi-Weekly\n\n# Project Summary\n\n## Project description\n\nSearch engine is based on [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and it is best in one thing, indexing and searching content. Current version of Search Engine is working good but we want to improve it so content ranking and indexing works better within community searches, optimize fields, add check for efficiency and of course we want to provide Open API access to all who wants to build on Hive. \n\nHome: https://hivesearcher.com\nGithub: https://github.com/ecency/hive2elastic\n\n## Benefits\n\nRight now, Search engine is used by all major frontends, **Hive.blog, Peakd.com and Ecency.com** and to cover part of the server costs, we have monthly payment for API key and plans with limited access. We want to remove those limits and open it up for every app to integrate. https://search.esteem.app/api-register\nThere are potentially unlimited opportunities for developers to increase exposure or create new types of apps, content discovery could be improved by different creative approaches.\n\n## What happens if the proposal becomes unfunded?\n\nIn case proposal becomes unfunded, we will continue to have monthly fees or increase fees to cover server cost with not much development. It will likely end up being non-sustainable and every app creating their own private versions costing even more and unstable user experience. And difficult to potential new developers/apps to integrate and use.\n\n## Explanation of proposal costs\n\nIn terms of development, as mentioned above, we will improve indexing and ranking, introduce new filters. New indexing will increase server costs as Elastic search will need new cluster and more storage to handle indexes. We are creating this proposal for just 6 months. After 6 months, we will create new proposal with smaller amount just to cover server costs. We think, by then not much new development will be needed.\n\n# Support this proposal\n\n[Vote for this Proposal using Hivesigner](https://hivesigner.com/sign/update-proposal-votes?proposal_ids=%5B114%5D&approve=true)\nHiveDao: https://hivedao.com/proposal/114\nPeakD: https://peakd.com/proposals/114\nHiveBlog Wallet: https://wallet.hive.blog/proposals\nGithub: https://github.com/ecency/hive2elastic\n\n# Progress update\n\n- [From Esteem Search to Hivesearcher - 06/17/2020](https://ecency.com/hive-139531/@good-karma/from-esteem-search-to-hivesearcher)\n- [Hivesearcher vs Hivemind Search - 06/24/2020](https://ecency.com/hive/@good-karma/hivesearcher-vs-hivemind-search)\n- [Hivesearcher.com alive - 07/27/2020](https://ecency.com/search/@good-karma/hivesearcher-com-is-alive)\n- [Free, integrate it into your Hive apps - 09/10/2020](https://ecency.com/hive-139531/@good-karma/hivesearcher-free-integrate-it-into-your-hive-apps)\n- [Hivesearcher updates after HF24 - 11/09/2020](https://ecency.com/hive-139531/@good-karma/hivesearcher-update-indexing-improvements)\n- [Hivesearcher website opensourced - 11/27/2020](https://ecency.com/hive-139531/@good-karma/hivesearcher-website-opensourced)",

We have been hard at work developing website and improving tech, background services to handle new product releases. We will post some updates until release to give overview of what to expect and how things will work.\n\n![Ecency-release-logo](https://images.ecency.com/DQmdWiLkE1ccp9UYnXbz6ofsxkUhYQo1eCh9X24kKLYTk3a/ecency_announcement.png)\n\nCurrent implementation of https://esteem.app was good, it was quite fast but we wanted to push our limits to make it even more faster and beautiful to explore communities, discover better content and authors. Add login and account management on top of it.\n\nLoading time is one of the most important factor for us. We want you to enjoy website that loads really fast. Really happy with results so far, we are also experimenting with different user experience to balance speed and convenience. After release, we will gather your feedback and improve features gradually that benefits you. \n\n-----\n\nEsteem has one of the best multi-account management and login system, with Ecency website we are first rolling out Login with [Hivesigner](https://hivesigner.com). We think, you will enjoy managing your accounts and login with ease.\n\n-----\n\nWe are also using our own instance of [Imagehoster](https://esteem.app/hive-139531/@good-karma/imagehoster-hivesigner-and-condenser-bounty).\nLast few months we have experimented with different image hosting and proxying solutions. Perhaps will make separate post about what we tried and what was outcomes of different solutions. Our team is small but we knew we could setup our own, decent imagehoster instance to keep things more decentralized. So far, from our tests, we can see that it is performing really well. We are eager to see performance of it in production once we release website.\n\n-----\n\nEsteem points (ESTM), will also be migrated into Ecency with just placeholder name Points. We have learned a lot over last few months about how points are helping you to stay active and bootstrap your social experience, etc. so Points will be part of Ecency as well.\n\nhttps://ecency.com will have all of above and more.\n\nMobile app and desktop apps will also get fresh look with our new brand images. Many more improvements, which we will talk in separate posts.\n\nStay tuned, stay excited! \n\n<center>`hello@ecency.com`\n🌐[`Ecency.com`](https://ecency.com) | ✍🏻 [`Telegram`](https://t.me/ecency) | 💬[`Discord`](https://discord.me/ecency)\n  [`Approve Hivesigner`](https://hivesigner.com/sign/update-proposal-votes?proposal_ids=%5B88%5D&approve=true) | [`Approve Hivesearcher`](https://hivesigner.com/sign/update-proposal-votes?proposal_ids=%5B114%5D&approve=true)\n[![Vote for @good-karma as a witness](https://images.ecency.com/p/o1AJ9qDyyJNSpZWhUgGYc3MngFqoAN2qn9AiTn8UpLP6Qb5TL?format=match&mode=fit)](https://hivesigner.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=good-karma&approve=1)\n</center>",

Big milestone is achieved, most of the heavy work related to backend and services completed. We will need your help testing it now.\n\nGive Ecency a try and let us know if you find any issues! \n\nMobile updates also ready, we will do final tests and publish updates to Google PlayStore and AppStore this week.
